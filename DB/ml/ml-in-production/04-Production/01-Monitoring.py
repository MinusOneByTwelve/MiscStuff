# MAGIC ## Drift Monitoring
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The majority of machine learning solutions assume that data is generated according to a stationary probability distribution. However, because most datasets involving human activity change over time, machine learning solutions often go stale. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For example, a model trained to predict restaurant sales before the COVID-19 pandemic would likely not be an accurate model of restaurant sales during the pandemic. The distribution generating the data changed, or drifted, over time. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Drift is composed of number of different types:<br><br> 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * **Data Drift**
# MAGIC   * **Data Changes**
# MAGIC     * In practice, upstream data changes is one of the most common sources of drift
# MAGIC     * For instance, null records from a changed ETL task
# MAGIC   * **Feature Drift** 
# MAGIC     * Change in the distribution of an input feature(s)
# MAGIC     * Change in \\(P(X)\\)
# MAGIC   * **Label Drift**
# MAGIC     * Change in the distribution of the label in the data
# MAGIC     * Change in  \\(P(Y)\\)
# MAGIC   * **Prediction Drift** 
# MAGIC       * Change in the distribution of the predicted label given by the model
# MAGIC       * Change in \\(P(\hat{Y}| X)\\) 
# MAGIC * **Concept Drift** 
# MAGIC   * Change in the relationship between input variables and label
# MAGIC   * Change in distribution of \\(P(Y| X)\\)
# MAGIC   * Likely results in an invalid current model
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **A rigorous monitoring solution for drift entails monitoring each cause of drift.**

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC It is important to note that each situation will need to be handled differently and that the presence of drift does not immediately indicate a need to replace the current model. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For example:
# MAGIC * Imagine a model designed to predict snow cone sales with temperature as an input variable. If more recent data has higher temperatures and higher snow cone sales, we have both feature and label drift, but as long as the model is performing well, then there is not an issue. However, we might still want to take other business action given the change, so it is important to monitor for this anyway. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * However, if temperature rose and sales increased, but our predictions did not match this change, we could have concept drift and will need to retrain the model. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * In either case, we may want to alert the company of the changes in case they impact other business processes, so it is important to track all potential drift. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **In order to best adapt to possible changes, we compare data and predictions across time windows to identify any kind of drift that could be occuring.**

# MAGIC The essence of drift monitoring is **running statistical tests on time windows of data.** This allows us to detect drift and localize it to specific root causes. Here are some solutions:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Numeric Features**
# MAGIC * Summary Statisitcs
# MAGIC   * Mean, Median, Variance, Missing value count, Max, Min
# MAGIC * Tests
# MAGIC   * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence" target="_blank">Jensen-Shannon</a>

# MAGIC     - Note: These tests vary largely in their assumption of normalcy and ability to handle larger data sizes
# MAGIC     - Do a check of normalcy and choose the appropriate test based on this (e.g. Mann-Whitney is more permissive of skew)

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC One interesting alternative is to frame monitoring as a supervised learning problem where you use your features and label as inputs to a model and your label is whether a given row comes from the training or inference set. As the model's accuracy improves, it would imply that the model as drifted.

# MAGIC ## Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Use the **Two-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test** for numeric features. This test determines whether or not two different samples come from the same distribution. This test:<br><br>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Returns a higher KS statistic when there is a higher probability of having two different distributions
# MAGIC - Returns a lower P value the higher the statistical significance
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In practice, we need a thershold for the p-value, where we will consider it ***unlikely enough*** that the samples did not come from the same distribution. Usually this threshold, or alpha level, is 0.05.

# MAGIC ## Jensen Shannon
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Jensen Shannon (JS) distance is more appropriate for drift detection on a large dataset since it **meaures the distance between two probability distributions and it is smoothed and normalized.** When log base 2 is used for the distance calculation, the JS statistic is bounded between 0 and 1:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - 0 means the distributions are identical
# MAGIC - 1 means the distributions have no similarity
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The JS distance is defined as the square root of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence" target="_blank">JS divergence</a>:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ![Jensen Shannon Divergence](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*viATYZeg9SiT-ZdzYGjKYA.png)

# MAGIC **Note:** The Two-way Chi-Squared test caught this not because nulls were introduced, but because they were introduced into one neighbourhood specifically, leading to an uneven distribution. If nulls were uniform throughout, then the test would see a similar distribution, just with lower counts, which this test would not flag as a change in dependence.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Optional Note on Chi-Squared tests.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For the Chi-Squared tests, distributions with low bin counts can invalidate the test's accuracy and lead to false positives.  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC There are also two types of Chi-Squared tests: One-way and Two-way (or contingency) tests. One-way testing is a goodness of fit test. It takes a single feature distribution and a population distribution and reports the probabilty of randomly drawing the single feature distribution from that population. In the context of drift monitoring, you would use the old time window as the population distribution and the new time window as the single feature distribution. If the p-value was low, then it would be likely that drift occured and that the new data no longer resembles the old distribution. This test compares counts, so if a more recent time window has a similar distribution but less data in it, this will return a low p-value when it perhaps should not. In that situation, try the Two-way test. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The Two-way or contingency test used above is rather a test for independence. It takes in a table where the rows represent time window 1 and 2 and the columns represent feature counts for a given feature. It determines whether or not there is a relationship between the time window and the feature distributions, or, in other words, if the distributions are independent of the time window. It is important to note that this test will not catch differences such as a decrease in total counts in the distribution. This makes it useful when comparing time windows with unequal amounts of data, but make sure to check for changes in null counts or differences in counts separately that you might care about. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Both of these assume high bin counts (generally >5) for each category in order to work properly. In our example, because of the large number of categories, some bin counts were lower than we would want for these tests. Fortunately, the scipy implementation of the Two-way test utilizes a correction for low counts that makes the Two-way preferable to the One-way in this situation, although ideally we would still want higher bin counts. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The Fisher Exact test is a good alternative in the situation where the counts are too low, however there is currently no Python implemenation for this test in a contingency table larger than 2x2. If you are looking to run this test, you should explore using R. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC These are subtle differences that are worth taking into account, but in either case, a low p-value would indicate significantly different distributions across the time window and therefore drift for the One-Way or Two-way Chi-Squared.

# MAGIC ## Drift Monitoring Architecture
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC A potential workflow for deployment and dirft monitoring could look something like this:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ![Azure ML Pipeline](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/monitoring.png)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Workflow**
# MAGIC * ***Deploy a model to production, using MLflow and Delta to log the model and data***
# MAGIC * ***When the next time step of data arrives:***
# MAGIC   * Get the logged input data from the current production model
# MAGIC   * Get the observed (true) values
# MAGIC   * Compare the evaluation metric (e.g. RMSE) between the observed values and predicted values
# MAGIC   * Run the statistical tests shown above to identify potential drift
# MAGIC * ***If drift is not found:***
# MAGIC   * Keep monitoring but leave original model deployed
# MAGIC * ***If drift is found:***
# MAGIC   * Analyze the situation and take action
# MAGIC   * If retraining/deploying an updated model is needed:
# MAGIC     * Create a candidate model on the new data
# MAGIC     * Deploy candidate model as long as it performs better than the current model on the more recent data

# MAGIC In this lesson, we focused on statistical methods for identifying drift. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC However, there are other methods.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <a href="https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/" target="_blank">The package `skmultiflow`</a> has some good options for drift detection algorithms. Try the DDM method.
# MAGIC

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The detection threshold is calculated as a function of two statistics, obtained when `(pi + si)` is minimum:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC  * `pmin`: The minimum recorded error rate
# MAGIC  * `smin`: The minimum recorded standard deviation
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC At instant `i`, the detection algorithm uses:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC  * `pi`: The error rate at instant i
# MAGIC  * `si`: The standard deviation at instant i
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The default conditions for entering the warning zone and detecting change are as follows:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC  * if `pi + si >= pmin + 2 * smin` -> Warning zone
# MAGIC  * if `pi + si >= pmin + 3 * smin` -> Change detected
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Model Based Approaches
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC A much less intuitive but possibly more powerful approach would focus on a machine learning based solution. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Some common examples: 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 1. Create a supervised approach on a dataset of data classified as normal or abnormal. Finding such a dataset can be difficult, however. 
# MAGIC 2. Use a regression method to predict future values for incoming data over time and detect drift if there is strong prediction error.
