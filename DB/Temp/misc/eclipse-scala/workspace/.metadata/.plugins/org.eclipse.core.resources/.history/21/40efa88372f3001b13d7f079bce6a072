// EXERCISE
// Create a list of the numbers 1-20; your job is to print out numbers that are evenly divisible by three. (Scala's
// modula operator, like other languages, is %, which gives you the remainder after division. For example, 9 % 3 = 0
// because 9 is evenly divisible by 3.) Do this first by iterating through all the items in the list and testing each
// one as you go. Then, do it again by using a filter function on the list instead.
